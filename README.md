# Enhancing Avalanche Victim Identification: Leveraging AI/ML Technologies for Efficient Detection in Harsh Terrain


This innovative project aims to revolutionize avalanche victim identification by harnessing the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies. In the unforgiving and treacherous landscapes of avalanche-prone regions, locating and identifying avalanche victims swiftly is a matter of life and death. Traditional search and rescue operations can be slow and resource-intensive, often hindered by challenging terrain and adverse weather conditions.

Our solution combines cutting-edge AI and ML algorithms with advanced sensing and image processing technologies. By leveraging this powerful synergy, we empower search and rescue teams with the ability to detect and locate avalanche victims more efficiently and accurately than ever before. Our system can analyze complex data from various sources, including aerial imagery, ground sensors, and even remote drones, to provide real-time information on victim locations.

This project aims to make a significant impact on avalanche rescue efforts, saving valuable time and increasing the chances of survival for those caught in these perilous situations. We are committed to pushing the boundaries of technology to enhance the safety and effectiveness of search and rescue operations in harsh avalanche terrain.

## Idea and Approach

We are actively pursuing a comprehensive solution through the development of specialized software aimed at providing users with avalanche prediction details, thereby safeguarding them from venturing into avalanche-prone areas. Subsequently, we plan to leverage cutting-edge AI/ML algorithms to create a sophisticated system that will be deployed on autonomous Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) platforms. This system will efficiently detect and track individuals buried beneath avalanches, furnishing precise victim information. This invaluable data will enable rescue teams to execute timely and effective operations.

Our approach to this endeavor is structured into two distinct yet interconnected phases, each of which will be elaborated upon in the subsequent sections:
- Prediction Model
- Response Model


Prediction Model:

In this phase, we will focus on the development of a robust predictive model. This model will utilize a combination Ahistorical data, meteorological information, and terrain analysis to accurately forecast potential avalanche occurrences. The objective is to provide users with timely and reliable information, empowering them to make informed decisions and avoid areas at risk.
